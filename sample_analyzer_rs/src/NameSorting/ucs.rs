//! UCS classification — the implementation of Documentation/ucs_signature_spec.md.
//!
//! The previous version of this module hardcoded `let cat = "MUSICAL"` and could
//! therefore only ever emit one of the 82 categories. It also never looked at the
//! file name, and never read the 753-entry synonym table sitting next to it.
//!
//! What it does now, per the spec:
//!
//!   1. GATES     hard constraints; a violation zeroes the candidate outright.
//!   2. PRIORS    weighted Gaussian log-likelihood -> S(c|x), the signal term.
//!   3. TEXT      synonym hits in the file and folder name -> T(c|name).
//!   4. POSTERIOR P ∝ S^α · T^β, with α/β set by the subcategory's honesty tier,
//!                so a `semantic_only` subcategory is decided by words and a
//!                `signal_separable` one by physics.
//!   5. ABSTAIN   a weak or a too-close win falls back to the category's MISC.
//!
//! Two deliberate departures from the spec, both documented at their constant:
//! the text term is IDF-weighted (`idf`), and lossy sources get leniency
//! (`LOSSY_UNRELIABLE`).
