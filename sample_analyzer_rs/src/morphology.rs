//! Morphology features — the "proposed" set of `ucs_signature_spec.md` §4b.
//!
//! These exist because the UCS signatures ask for them: 329 priors reference
//! `stationarity`, 202 `decay_time_seconds_60db`, 148 `voicing_ratio`. Until now
//! the scorer had no field to read them from, so `ucs::feature()` returned None
//! and every one of those terms was dropped from the likelihood — the signatures
//! were being scored on a fraction of the evidence they were written against.
//!
//! Every value is an `Option`: "we could not measure this" is a different
//! statement from "this is zero", and the scorer must be able to tell them
//! apart (spec §6 — a missing feature is skipped and its weight renormalized
//! away, never treated as 0).
//!
//! All of these ride on the STFT and amplitude envelope the analyzer already
//! computes, so the cost is arithmetic, not another transform.
